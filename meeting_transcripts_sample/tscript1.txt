Date: February 4, 2026
Attendees: 	 (PM), James (Engineering Lead), Lisa (Design), Marcus (Marketing)

---

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's kick off with our Q1 roadmap. We need to finalize features and timelines today.

James: I've reviewed the backlog. We have 45 items flagged. With current velocity of 12 points per sprint, we can realistically deliver about 36 points this quarter.

Lisa: From design perspective, we've completed mockups for the new dashboard and the mobile app redesign. Both are ready for engineering handoff. The dashboard will take about 3 weeks to implement.

Marcus: Marketing wants to highlight three key features in our Q1 campaign: the new dashboard, improved API performance, and the mobile app. We'll need launch dates to coordinate with PR.

Sarah: Let's prioritize. Dashboard is tier-1. James, can we commit to that?

James: Yes, dashboard in weeks 1-3. After that we can do mobile app redesign, which Lisa estimates at 2 weeks of design work.

Lisa: Confirmed. Mockups are 95% done. One more review cycle needed.

Marcus: If we launch dashboard by end of February, we can run a campaign starting March 1st. That gives us 4 weeks of marketing runway before end of Q1.

Sarah: Perfect. So decisions:
1. Dashboard is priority - target end of February
2. Mobile redesign follows - target mid-March
3. Marketing campaign launch March 1st

James: We also need to allocate 20% of capacity for bug fixes and technical debt. Current production issues are impacting 12% of users daily.

Sarah: Agreed. Lisa, can you make sure design reviews are unblocking engineering?

Lisa: Yes, I'll do daily syncs with James starting next week.

Marcus: Budget-wise, we're approved for $50k for Q1. We've spent $12k so far on contractor support and tools.

Sarah: Great. Action items:
- James: Provide detailed sprint plan by EOD tomorrow
- Lisa: Complete dashboard design review by Friday
- Marcus: Finalize Q1 marketing timeline by Wednesday
- Sarah: Schedule weekly standups starting next Monday

Meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM. Next sync: February 11, 2026.
