Meeting: Brainstorming Feature X
Date: Feb 10, 2026
Attendees: Team Alpha

- What if we add a voice-activated taco orderer?
- Too specific. Maybe just general "voice commands"?
- "Meeting Intelligence System, order me a pizza."
- Focus on productivity! Auto-summarization is the key.
- Everyone has that. We need something unique. 
- "Emotional sentiment analysis of the CEO's jokes."
- (Laughter)
- Let's stick to automated action item tracking for now.
