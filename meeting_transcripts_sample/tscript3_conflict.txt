Meeting: Budget Crisis Talk
Date: February 6, 2026
Attendees: Karen (CFO), Mike (Department Head), Chloe (Operations)

Karen: Mike, these numbers don't add up. You're 40% over budget on hardware procurement.
Mike: We had to scale for the rush! The old servers were literally smoking.
Karen: You didn't get approval. This is a violation of the fiscal policy.
Chloe: If I can interject, we could offset this by reducing the travel budget for next quarter.
Mike: Absolutely not! We have three conferences in March.
Karen: I'm freezing all non-essential spending until this is reconciled. 
Mike: (Interrupting) You're going to kill the project velocity.
Karen: The project won't matter if we're insolvent. Meeting over.
